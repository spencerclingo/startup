You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.)

### Key features

- A daily schedule where you can create events
- The ability to share events and schedules with friends
- Motivational quotes to help you keep the desire to be effective

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Structure the website pages. There will be a home page, a login, and a calendar page where events can be created and seen. 
- **CSS** - Beautify the website to enhance the user experience. It will help the website scale to difference screen sizes and be effective.
- **React** - Provide interactability for the users and design the event planner. This will also enable the login service. Backend endpoint calls will be done through React as well. 
- **Service** - Motivational quotes to encourage users to keep planning, as well as creating events and inviting users. 
- **DB/Login** - People's events and login information are stored in the database.
- **WebSocket** - Users who are working together on events can talk about them.
